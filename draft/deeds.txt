Notes:
- Each Clans needs a collection of tokens with their color, refered to as Clan
   Markers.
- Deeds may only be performed once per game.
- Shared Deeds are meant to encourage players to communicate and plan together,
   which may of course result in some interesting betrayals.
- Individual Deeds are meant to acknowledge interesting plays.
- Thematically, the Clans earn points because such Deeds ensure they are
   remembered through history.

Setup:
   - Give each Clan their Markers.
   - TBD: all deeds available vs random draw of a certain amount vs random draw
      of a certain amount per category vs some always available and others
      randomly drawn.

Shared Deeds (rewards all participating Clans):
   Pourparler:
      Condition: Two or more opposing Daimyos, alone in a province.
      Reward: 10 Victory Points.

   Schism:
      Condition:
         Two or more Shintos of a Clan alone in facing only one or more opposing
         Kami.
      Reward: 10 Victory Points.

   The Great War:
      Condition:
         Battle Resolution between two or more non-allied armies, each of which
         has a force of 10 or more.
      Reward: 15 Victory Points (only for Clans with armies of 10+ force)

Individual Deeds:
   Through Hearts Alone:
      Condition: Win a battle without spending any coin.
      Reward: 5 Victory Points

   A Clan of Nomads:
      Condition: Reach Winter without a single Province Tile
      Reward: 20 Victory Points
      Note:
         This is a lot of points, but also very hard to pull off if people
         see you are going for it.

   Trust the Seers:
      Condition: Won all performed actions of a battle through ties.
      Reward: 7 Victory Points
      Note:
         This is actually doable fairly easily when facing an opponent that has
         very few coins and needs a specific strategy to win. But it also adds
         more consideration to that otherwise predicable situation.
